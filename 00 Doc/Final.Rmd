Our data was taken from <https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/> The file we chose from this website is called TechCrunch Continental USA and contains the listing 1,460 company funding records reported by TechCrunch. 

The Steps

Step 1
The first step to produce our project was to look for the data. Our data was taken from <https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/>. The file we chose from this website is called TechCrunch Continental USA and contains the listing 1,460 company funding records reported by TechCrunch. 

Step 2
Once we chose our data we begun to set up the data to create the oracle database. We modified the R_ETL.R. file to load our csv file into our oracle account. This file can be found under the folder named 02 Data Wrangling by the name 'Set up.R'

Here's a summary of what our data looks like. 
```{r}
source("../01 Data/Summary_Data.R", echo = TRUE)
```

The data in column 'round' stands for the following 
— Pre-funding: You build a prototype of your product.
— Seed Round: The funding necessary to launch your product.
— A Round: The funding necessary to get product traction.
— B Round: The funding necessary to scale your product

Step 3
Once we had our data in place we continued by playing around with data wrangling. In the file 02 Data Wrangling there's a script called First_RE.R which contains our data wrangling. 

```{r}
source("../01 Data Wrangling/First_RE.R", echo=TRUE)

```

Step 4 
Here's our first data wrangling. 

Step 5
Here's our second data wrangling

Step 6 
Here's our third data wrangling. In this one we used group_by() 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
